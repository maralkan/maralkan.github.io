                    <p><strong>International Date Line</strong></p>
                    <p>When we go around the world, we cross 24 time zones.</p>
                    <p><strong>Magellan Expedition</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Sept 20, 1519 - Sept 8, 1522</em></p>
                    <p>To Magellan's crew, it was Sunday. To Spainiards, it was Monday. Inquisitors thought that the crew sold a day to the devil. Scholars of the day quickly explained the date phenomenon. Saved by science!</p>
                    <p><strong>Daylight-Savings Time</strong></p>
                    <p>Move clocks ahead by an hour during the summer months ... "Spring Ahead; Fall Back!" This system was originally used by Germans during World War II and it's now practiced by many nations</p>
                    <p>This sytem conserves lighting energy by providing an extra hour of daylight.</p>
                    <p>Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that don't follow this system. The Navajo Nation, however, about 20% of Arizona, uses the DS system. The Hopi reservation, a reservation surrounded by the Navajo nation does <em>not</em> follow the system just because the Navajo do.</p>

                    <p><strong>Earth's Revolution around the Sun</strong></p>
                    <p>One revolution takes 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes. The Earth follows an elliptical orbit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aphelion 93.6 million miles (152,171,500 km)</li>
                        <li>Perihelion 93 million miles (147,166,480 km)</li>
                        <li>Average distance 93 million miles (149,597,892 km)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Earth is at the perihelion during Northern Hemisphere winter; and at the aphelion during Northern Hemisphere summer</p>
                    <p>Earth's tilt is 23.5 degrees off of the elliptical orbit plane</p>
                    <p><strong>Annual March of the Seasons</strong></p>
                    <p>Three important conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declination of the Sun</li>
                        <li>Solar altitude</li>
                        <li>Length of day</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are Two solstices in June and December</p>
                    <p>December solstice</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Occurs on approximately December 22 each year</li>
                        <li>Sun is directly overhead at 23.5 degree S latitude</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>From beneath you, it devours. Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? No, Angel, it's not you. If I was blind, I would see you. Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a criminal mastermind now.</p>
                    <p>The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. I'm a comfortador also. Oh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates.</p>

                    <p>I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! And zombies don't eat brains anyway, unless instructed to by their zombie master. It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? She is the slayer. I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.</p>

                    <p>Everybody started singing and dancing. I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! So, are we gonna sing army songs or something? I am obsolete. This must be what old people feel like, and Blockbuster. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. I'm a rogue demon hunter now. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. Oh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night.</p>

                    <p>It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to. It's a real burn, being right so often. They need to take seven and they might take yours. We're old friends from Navy. Friends from Old Navy. I worked retail, he'd come in, buy slacks My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do?</p>
