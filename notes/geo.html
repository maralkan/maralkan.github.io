                    <p>The Nature of Atmospheric Pressure</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gas molecules continuously in motion</li>
                        <li>At sea level, one square inch of a column of air weighs about 14 lbs.</li>
                        <li>Barometer: variations in the weight of the air will bring the mercury up or down. Why do you vacuum the air?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Factors influencing atmospheric pressure</p>
                    <p>Mapping pressure with isobars</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressure measured with a barometer</li>
                        <li>Typical unites are millibars or inches of mercury</li>
                        <li>Contour pressure values reduced to sea level</li>
                        <li>Shows highs and lows, ridges and troughs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The Nature of Wind</strong></p>
                    <p>Uneven heating of Earth's surface creates temperature and pressure gradients. Direction of wind results from pressure gradient. Winds blow from high pressure to low pressure.</p>
                    <p>Forces which govern the wind</p>
                    <p>Pressure gradient force</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Characterized by wind moving from high to low pressure, always</li>
                        <li>Winds blow at right angles to isobars</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Coriolis Force</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turns wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, left in southern Hemisphere</li>
                        <li>Only affects wind direction, not speed, though faster winds turn more</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Friction</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wind is slowed by Earth's surface due to friction, does not affect upper levels</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Anticyclones and Cyclones</strong></p>
                    <p>Vertical Motions</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surface convergence and low pressure indicate rising motion, cyclone - clouds</li>
                        <li>Surface divergence and high pressure indicate sinking motion, anticyclone - clear air/weather</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Wind Speed</strong></p>
                    <p>Mapping image again, where there is a greater gradient, there will be higher wind speeds. The isobar lines will be closer together.</p>
                    <p><strong>General Circulation of the Atmosphere</strong></p>
                    <p>Atmosphere is in constant motion</p>
                    <p>Major semipermanent conditions of wind and pressure-- general circulation</p>
                    <p>semipermanent convection cell near the equator and 3 latitiudinal wind belts per hemisphere</p>
                    <p>ITCZ is an area where winds converge and they move into the high troposphere</p>
                    <p>These winds then split north/south and become antitrade winds - winds that experience the coriolis effect a lot more and travel nearly laterally close to 30&deg; N/S. At these latitudes, there are almost permanent high pressure zones.</p>
                    <p>Polar front occurs due to winds coming from N &amp; S.</p>
                    <p><strong>Subtropical Highs</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persistent zones of high pressure near 30&deg; latitude in both hemispheres</li>
                        <li>Result from descending air in Hadley cells</li>
                        <li>Subsidence is common over these regions</li>
                        <li>Regions of world's major deserts</li>
                        <li>Known as horse latitudes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICTZ)</strong></p>
                    <p>Region of convergence of the trade winds, there is a constant rising motion from the winds.</p>

                    <p><strong>World distribution of insolation</strong></p>
                    <p>Average Daily insolation decreases with increasing latitude. During the winter, Southern latitudes will have higher rates of insolation and Northern latitudes will have lower rates of insolation. The converse occurs during the summer.</p>
                    <p>Land heats and cools more rapidly than water due to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific heat</li>
                        <li>Transmission</li>

                        <li>Evaporative cooling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Land and Water Contrasts</p>
                    <p>San Diego and Dallas are at the same latitude, have roughly the same elevation, yet they differ significantly in their monthly average temperatures. San Diego has a more stable temperature curve due to its proximity to the ocean.</p>
                    <p><strong>Global Temperature Patterns</strong></p>
                    <p>Img: map showing average temperature</p>
                    <p>To get average temperature for a day, you take the highest temperature and the lowest temperature and then divide it by 2.</p>
                    <p>All of these temperatures have been reduced to their sea-level equivalents. The troposphere has an average decline of temperature is -3.6&deg;F/1000 ft.</p>

                    <p>One revolution takes 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes. The Earth follows an elliptical orbit.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Earth is at the perihelion during Northern Hemisphere winter; and at the aphelion during Northern Hemisphere summer</p>
                    <p>Earth's tilt is 23.5 degrees off of the elliptical orbit plane</p>

                    <p><strong>Magellan Expedition</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Sept 20, 1519 - Sept 8, 1522</em></p>
                    <p>To Magellan's crew, it was Sunday. To Spainiards, it was Monday. Inquisitors thought that the crew sold a day to the devil. Scholars of the day quickly explained the date phenomenon. Saved by science!</p>

                    <p>Move clocks ahead by an hour during the summer months ... "Spring Ahead; Fall Back!" This system was originally used by Germans during World War II and it's now practiced by many nations</p>

                    <p>Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that don't follow this system. The Navajo Nation, however, about 20% of Arizona, uses the DS system. The Hopi reservation, a reservation surrounded by the Navajo nation does <em>not</em> follow the system just because the Navajo do.</p>

                    <p>These people weren't the best people to be neighbors with... because they were really nosy and they weren't pleasant people. They came to America. So they said, as long as we gotta go, we'll go somewhere pleasant. So they wanted weather like that of southern Spain and France. So they brought their summer clothes and crops that would grow in a Mediterranean climate. So they went straight to Massachusetts. They lost a lot of people because of this bad judgment.</p>

It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? She is the slayer.
