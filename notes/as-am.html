                        <p>Read excerpt LuXun's Preface</p>
                        <p>How does Lu Xun perceive his country and fellow countrymen? What is his rationale for writing?</p>
                        <p>Lu Xun is very sad and is almost at the point of despair for his fellow countrymen. He is astonished at the lack of empathy for other Chinese people. Other nations have kinda jumped ahead of them and they have to play "catch-up".</p>
                        <p>As LuXun watches this clip of his countrymen, his idea of wanting to better society by healing it shifts from healing the physical to healing the spiritual.</p>
                        <p>How can you change culture? Literature.</p>
                        <p>This is going to be a way to popularize these views. By writing with vernacular Chinese.</p>
                        <p>He's not saying that we're adopting everything that's Western but we're going to create a unique culture that's Chinese.</p>

                        <p>What is the nature of the relationship between the narrator and his brother? How are other family relationships significant in this story?</p>
                        <ul><li>They are "educating each other". There's this idea of filial piety that's taken to an extreme in this diary. These ideas have become so ingrained in these people that they have started taking it literally.</li></ul>
                        <p>How does "education" play into the narrator's madness?</p>

                        <p>So, has he eaten human flesh? Yeah. The fish they were eating was like his "sister".</p>

                    <p>Taoism is all about emptying the mind and ridding oneself of knowledge to achieve happiness. It is the knowledge of the things that you desire and the things that you want that make you unhappy.</p>
                    <p><em>Personally, I disagree with Taoism because I find it self-contradictory. You learn these things so that you can unlearn these things. You find happiness by ridding yourself of knowledge and teachers of this doctrine are hypocrites for teaching this doctrine because they must rid themselves of all knowledge so that they can be happy. I also think that unhappiness can stem from relationships because we may say something hurtful to someone and thereby cause pain to someone. I believe that unhapiness is much more than that. I also believe that hapiness is much more than just ridding yourself of materialism.</em></p>

                        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/600/150/people/3" alt="Sample Image" class="item-image" />
                        <p>What is the nature of the "white man's burden"?</p>
                        <p>The white man's burden is to educate others, to be a slave to bringing others to your level.</p>
                        <p>Who is the intended audience for this poem?</p>
                        <p>The intended audience is White people. This is around the time of Teddy Roosevelt and Big Stick Diplomacy where people are thinking that they have the right to involve themselves in other peoples' matters.</p>
                        <p>What seems to be the underlying message of this poem?</p>
                        <p>It's an exercise of power. A mission where the white man attempts to civilize "the other". You construct "the other" and you use that to make policy. The white man does all this work for these other peoples and they go and mess it up just like a child. <quote>"Watch sloth and heathen Folly<br>Bring all your hopes to nought."<br>- <em>excerpt</em> from The White Man's Burden</quote> The white man is the one who is going to take these peoples to the promised land but the other doesn't want to go there.</p>
                        <p>People are exploring the world and they're forming their opinions of "the other".</p>

                        <p>This got the US involved directly with the Philippines. Initially, the US is looking out to Cuba. But in the conflict, they also move to the Philippines to provide for Filipino revolutionaries to fight against the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>Spain loses this war and the control of the Philippine Islands is ceded to the US. Pres. McKinley wants to bring these people to view the US as a provider of "benevolent assimilation".</p>

                        <quote>"you have been greatly deceived in the personality of my countrymen... You went to the Philippines under the impression that their inhabitants were ignorant savages... We have been represented by your popular press as if we were Africans or Mohawk Indians... You repeat constantly the dictum that we cannot govern ourselves..."<p>- Aguinaldo</p></quote>
