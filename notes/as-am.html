                        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/600/150/people/3" alt="Sample Image" class="item-image" />
                        <p>What is the nature of the "white man's burden"?</p>
                        <p>The white man's burden is to educate others, to be a slave to bringing others to your level.</p>
                        <p>Who is the intended audience for this poem?</p>
                        <p>The intended audience is White people. This is around the time of Teddy Roosevelt and Big Stick Diplomacy where people are thinking that they have the right to involve themselves in other peoples' matters.</p>
                        <p>What seems to be the underlying message of this poem?</p>
                        <p>It's an exercise of power. A mission where the white man attempts to civilize "the other". You construct "the other" and you use that to make policy. The white man does all this work for these other peoples and they go and mess it up just like a child. <quote>"Watch sloth and heathen Folly<br>Bring all your hopes to nought."<br>- <em>excerpt</em> from The White Man's Burden</quote> The white man is the one who is going to take these peoples to the promised land but the other doesn't want to go there.</p>
                        <p>People are exploring the world and they're forming their opinions of "the other".</p>

                        <h4 class="item-title">Spanish-American War (1898)</h4>
                        <p>This got the US involved directly with the Philippines. Initially, the US is looking out to Cuba. But in the conflict, they also move to the Philippines to provide for Filipino revolutionaries to fight against the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>Spain loses this war and the control of the Philippine Islands is ceded to the US. Pres. McKinley wants to bring these people to view the US as a provider of "benevolent assimilation".</p>

                        <p>Insurgency because they wanted to declare independence. America decided to not give it to them yet. The sort of thought was "you can't handle democracy".</p>
                        <quote>"you have been greatly deceived in the personality of my countrymen... You went to the Philippines under the impression that their inhabitants were ignorant savages... We have been represented by your popular press as if we were Africans or Mohawk Indians... You repeat constantly the dictum that we cannot govern ourselves..."<p>- Aguinaldo</p></quote>

                        <p>There was an exhibit on Filipino people. They wanted to exhibit the "savage" that they "saved" from the Spaniards. You can come to the exhibit to see Filipinos eat dogs.</p>
                        <p>These bodies were objectified. They were seen as an object of research. Their remains would be split up to deliver to various institutions for research skull size and stuff.</p>

                    <h4 class="item-title">Thoughts on Taoism</h4>
                    <p>Taoism is all about emptying the mind and ridding oneself of knowledge to achieve happiness. It is the knowledge of the things that you desire and the things that you want that make you unhappy.</p>
                    <p><em>Personally, I disagree with Taoism because I find it self-contradictory. You learn these things so that you can unlearn these things. You find happiness by ridding yourself of knowledge and teachers of this doctrine are hypocrites for teaching this doctrine because they must rid themselves of all knowledge so that they can be happy. I also think that unhappiness can stem from relationships because we may say something hurtful to someone and thereby cause pain to someone. I believe that unhapiness is much more than that. I also believe that hapiness is much more than just ridding yourself of materialism.</em></p>
