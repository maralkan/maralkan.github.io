                      <p>Thunderstorms are cyclonic storms that produce thunder and lightning.</p>
                      <p>Convectional storms. In this case, the air mass is heated by convection from surface of the earth. The air rises and cools, causing condensation. But in this case, these storms are very unstable due to coming into contact with superheated terrain (frontal activity).</p>

                      <h4 class="item-title">Thunderstorm Types</h4>
                      <p>Ordinary - air mass thunderstorms. These storms develop due to superheating of the the surface of the earth. These are usually convectional and can also be associated with frontal activity.</p>
                      <p>Supercells - these storms are more severe, last longer, and can also be associated with convectional and frontal weather activities. Wind speeds can be 50 to 60 miles per hour. These storms can also cause tornadoes. The storm can maintain itself as a single entity for hours on end. Storms of this size can cause winds to go at speeds of up to 90 knots (103.7 mph).</p>

                      <h4 class="item-title">Life Cycle of an Ordinary Thunderstorm</h4>
                      <p>Stages:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Cumulus</li>
                        <li>Mature</li>
                        <li>Dissipation</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>Cold air moving up and cold air coming down causes cumulus clouds to form. Warm air goes up in updrafts and collides with the cold air. Air mass lifting spurs cloud development. Depending on the temperature of the drafts, precipitation may begin. The storm begins to dissipate when downdrafts begin to occur. Downdrafts in the form of gusts of wind are parts of the air mass that are cooling thereby dissipating the storm because there is less warm air to go up. These gusts cool the earth as well if the precipitation hasn't already done that.</p>

                      <h4 class="item-title">Wind Shear</h4>
                      <p>Ordinary thunderstorms usually occur where there is little wind shear. Wind shear, wind going at lower speeds and higher speeds at higher elevations, can cause extra tumbling of the air mass anc can cause more cells to form. Multi-cell supercells can form. Super unstable.</p>

                            <h4 class="item-title">Cumulus Clouds</h4>
                            <p>A cloud will form from an updraft of moist air.</p>
                            <p>There are warm and cold clouds. Some clouds are very large and span large distances in elevation. Cumulonimbus clouds will have various sectors. Super-cooled and warm sectors.</p>
                            <p>The super-cooled sector (20,000) will have ice crystals coalescing. The warm sector (6500), has water droplets.</p>
                            <p>An interesting effect that some clouds have is that some crystals from the super-cooled sector will act as condensation nuclei for water droplets in the warm sector and will also act as deposition nuclei for ice crystal formation. This is known as the Bergeron Process.</p>
                            <p>These clouds will give moderate to heavy precipitation. These are also the kinds of clouds that form thunderstorms.</p>

                            <h4 class="item-title">Cloud Seeding</h4>
                            <p>One can seed a cloud by dropping a block of frozen CO<sub>2</sub> from high elevation. The air will cool and become very saturated. Ice crystals will begin to form.</p>

                            <h4 class="item-title">Stratus Clouds</h4>
                            <p>These are flat clouds. Stratus clouds will give light to moderate precipitation because they're not very thick.</p>
                            <p>These are clouds that are lightly lifted. Lifting air gradually will produce thin clouds. These clouds can then be telling of the stability or instability of the atmosphere.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4 class="item-title">Forms of Precipitation</h4>
                            <p>Rain: in order for a water drop to be considered rain, it must be at least 0.5 mm in diameter. So, while most people will consider any drop of water as rain, meteorologists will not.</p>
                            <p>Most, if not all, types of precipitation, begins as ice crystals. If the bottom of the cloud is warm, we'll get rain. If the bottom is cold, we'll get snow. If the bottom is unstable and cold, we'll get hail. Cold air can be unstable because of air drafts. If there is a storm going on, the air can be cold and extremely unstable. It is then that you get hail.</p>
                            <p>Virga - this is the effect when rain falls from clouds but the rain evaporates before reaching the ground. This is probably something that happens in warm air. The cloud might bring down precipitation because the temperature is cool enough to bring the saturation up. But the temperature below the cloud might be much warmer, therefore the rain will evaporate. This often gives a sort of "curtain-like" visual.</p>
                            <p>Is it ever too cold to snow? No. We will have precipitation.</p>

            <h4>Temperature measurement in different atmospheric layers</h4>
            <p>There are major differences in temperature readings from thermometer.<br/>Near the surface of the earth, we have air that collides with a thermometer. Lots of air molecules collide.<br>However, in high layers of the atmosphere, there are simply too few air molecules to collide with a thermometer. High readings on thermometers correspond to heating by radiation from the sun. Molecules in this region are actually moving quite fast, but there are too few of them, so it <em>feels</em> cold.</p>

                        <li>Alitmeters, are barometers that record pressure and height</li>

                </ul>

            <p>Mapping Air Pressure</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Isobars</li>
                <li>Meteorologists look at lines of equal air pressure by taking in reports from many weather stations. Some stations might report 12 millibars, some others can report 10 millibars, and some can report 5 millibars. You just have to connect the dots and you get some circles that look like a geographic contour map that shows differences in elevation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wind</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What causes the initial movement of air?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pressure gradient. It's the difference between areas of high air pressure and low air pressure. If you're running into the wind, you're moving into a place of higher air pressure and if the wind is pushing you, you're moving into lower air pressure areas.</li>
                    <li>The closer the isobars get, the faster the wind will blow.</li>
                    <li>If the pressure gradient is very steep then the wind will move very fast</li>
                    <li>Example: Hurricane</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The eye of the storm is an area of low pressure. So the air rises in the eye and it falls in the storm, where the air pressure is very high.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>What influences wind direction?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coriolis Effect</li>
                    <li>Some of the air that touches the surface of the earth is going to move as a result of friction.</li>
                    <li>In the Northern hemisphere, wind will deflect to the right and the in the Southern hemisphere, the wind will deflect to the left.</li>
                    <li>Wind Deflection Patterns</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Northern hemisphere, a high pressure air parcel will have air flowing out to the right (&#1421;, &#8635;). A low pressure air parcel will have air moving into it from the right. &#1421;, &#8634;</li>
                        <li>Southern hemisphere, &#1422; H: &#8634;, L: &#8635;</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Wind Speed-Direction</li>
                <li>Air Mass Convergence / Divergence</li>
                <li>When you have converging wind closer to the surface of the earth, and diverging wind higher up, then you have rising air.</li>
                <li>If you have converging wind at high altitudes and diverging wind near the surface of the air, you have sinking air.</li>
                <li>Prevailing wind</li>
                <li>It can help determine where to place things in a city. A prevailing wind can be a significant factor in determing placement of landfills, city centers, and even house planning / building. The direction of the wind will influence in which direction pollutants may fly, where city centers would have the least amount of wind, where a house should be better insulated so that it can receive better insulation during the winter and receive ventilation during the summer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Weather Instruments</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weather Vane - direction</li>
                <li>Wind sock - direction</li>
                <li>Anemometer - speed (cups that spin)</li>
                <li>Aerovane - speed and direction</li>
                <li>Radiosonde - near the surface of the earth</li>
                <li>Satellites</li>
                <li>Doppler Radar emits microwaves and records the differences in disturbance</li>

            <h4>Scales of Atmospheric Motion</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Microscale</li>
                <li>Mesoscale - if we're talking about local winds</li>
                <li>Synoptic</li>
                <li>Global - if we're talking about the trade winds or the Westerlies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Eddies - Whirls of Air - when wind encounters an obstacle, an eddy will form on the objects down-wind side.</p>
            <p>Example - Mountains / speeds greater than 40 knots</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind moves on the windward side</li>
                <li>As the air moves over the tip of the mountain, an eddy may form - "mountain eddy"</li>
                <li>Air continues to flow in "mountain waves"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wind Shear - happens when air further away from the surface of the earth moves faster than air closer to the ground.</p>
            <p>Side note: an aircraft always wants to take off against the wind to get more lift. I've observed that on the same flight that I always take the plane will take off of many different directions to take the same route.</p>
            <h4>Local Wind and Pressure Systems</h4>
            <p>Sea Breezes - onshore breezes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High pressure over the sea and low pressure over the land.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Land Breezes - offshore breezes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High pressure over the land and low pressure over the sea.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mountain and Valley Breezes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Day</li>
                <li>Sun wamrs up higher elevation on a mountain and it creates a low air pressure. The valley has a higher pressure and air flows upward</li>
                <li>Night - Higher elevations on a mountain cool off faster, high pressure. Valley is still warm, low pressure. Wind from higher elevations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Chinook</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heating adiabatic winds</li>
                <li>Compressional winds</li>
                <li>Rocky Mts have hi pressure on the windward side and lo pressure on the leeway side/Great Plains.</li>
                <li>"Snow-Eaters" - these winds can melt a foot of snow in less than a day.</li>
            </ul>
