                    <p>At the current rate, sea ice in Arctic may completely disappear by about 2050. We can expect an increase in the number of tropical cyclones. The amount of water vapor will also increase. More incidents of heat waves, droughts (warmer droughts). More rain (more intense weather events, much further separated in time)</p>
                    <p>Kyoto Protocol - limit emissions of every country. The US didn't sign on (other countries did). Some states, including CA, did commit to meeting those requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
                    <p>Cap and Trade idea - limit emissions more every year. Imposing stricter regulation on companies and emissions.</p>

                    <p>Dry adiabatic lapse rate: -5.5&deg; / 1000 ft. If the air is rising or falling, then you use this rate to determine temperature. This lapse rate applies to air moving up or down. But if the air isn't moving, you use the environmental lapse rate (-3.6&deg; / 1000 ft).</p>
                    <p>Every cloud that I see is above a rising fountain of air. At the lower limit of that cloud, R/H becomes 100%.</p>
                    <p>Dew Point Temperature (DPT) is the temperature at which R/H is at 100%. AH = SC.</p>
                    <p>When air rises, it reaches its DPT. Condensation occurs and air continues to rise. But when water vapor condenses, it releases latent heat. So there is a difference between wet and dry adiabatic lapse rates. The dry rate is -5.5 and the wet lapse rate will be &lt;5.5.</p>

                    <p>Advection fog occurs near the coast. Here on the beaches of So-Cal, there is air that's coming in from the Pacific. The California current chills this air and we have clouds on the ground! :) </p>
                    <p>"Tule" fog - this is the fog that one can see on the 5 going towards Sacramento. Kind of radiation fog. San Joaquin River and Sacramento River form a delta. The mountain air chills the warmer, heavily moist air from above. Giving it a great thickness.</p>

                    <p>Four types of atmospheric lifting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Convection: an island might be 90&deg; with ocean surrounding it that is at 80&deg; at the surface. The relative low pressure are over the island will cause air to flow in from the ocean. Because the relative low pressure air is less dense, it's pushed up. So, at some point, precipitation occurs.</li>
                        <li>Orographic: where air flows towards a mountain and as it runs up the mountains, the air cools and forms clouds and maybe some precipitation. This is called the "rain shadow" effect.</li>
                        <li>Convergent: winds collide and push up. They cool adiabatically.</li>
                        <li>Frontal: Cold air bulldozes through warm air. Since the warm air is less dense, it gives no resistance and air pushes up along the cold front. This causes the air to cool and therefore get precipitation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Water condenses on something. Dust in the wind. This tends to make the water slightly acidic.</p>
                    <p>Human-induced chemicals bring sulfur and nitrous oxides into the air. So rain, when mixing with these chemicals, becomes more acidic.</p>

                    <p>San Diego and Dallas are at the same latitude, have roughly the same elevation, yet they differ significantly in their monthly average temperatures. San Diego has a more stable temperature curve due to its proximity to the ocean.</p>

                    <p>To get average temperature for a day, you take the highest temperature and the lowest temperature and then divide it by 2.</p>
                    <p>All of these temperatures have been reduced to their sea-level equivalents. The troposphere has an average decline of temperature is -3.6&deg;F/1000 ft.</p>

                    <p><strong>Earth's Revolution around the Sun</strong></p>
                    <p>One revolution takes 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes. The Earth follows an elliptical orbit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aphelion 93.6 million miles (152,171,500 km)</li>
                        <li>Perihelion 93 million miles (147,166,480 km)</li>
                        <li>Average distance 93 million miles (149,597,892 km)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Earth is at the perihelion during Northern Hemisphere winter; and at the aphelion during Northern Hemisphere summer</p>
                    <p>Earth's tilt is 23.5 degrees off of the elliptical orbit plane</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>There are Two solstices in June and December</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Occurs on approximately December 22 each year</li>
                        <li>Sun is directly overhead at 23.5 degree S latitude</li>

                    <p><strong>Magellan Expedition</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Sept 20, 1519 - Sept 8, 1522</em></p>
                    <p>To Magellan's crew, it was Sunday. To Spainiards, it was Monday. Inquisitors thought that the crew sold a day to the devil. Scholars of the day quickly explained the date phenomenon. Saved by science!</p>
                    <p><strong>Daylight-Savings Time</strong></p>
                    <p>Move clocks ahead by an hour during the summer months ... "Spring Ahead; Fall Back!" This system was originally used by Germans during World War II and it's now practiced by many nations</p>
                    <p>This sytem conserves lighting energy by providing an extra hour of daylight.</p>
                    <p>Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that don't follow this system. The Navajo Nation, however, about 20% of Arizona, uses the DS system. The Hopi reservation, a reservation surrounded by the Navajo nation does <em>not</em> follow the system just because the Navajo do.</p>

                    <p>These people weren't the best people to be neighbors with... because they were really nosy and they weren't pleasant people. They came to America. So they said, as long as we gotta go, we'll go somewhere pleasant. So they wanted weather like that of southern Spain and France. So they brought their summer clothes and crops that would grow in a Mediterranean climate. So they went straight to Massachusetts. They lost a lot of people because of this bad judgment.</p>
