                        <p>China, 1972 and North Korea, 2013. N. Korea loves basketball! Specifically, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Elites at North Korea not only get educated in North Korea, they also get sent abroad to get some education in Europe and other foreign nations.</p>

                       <p>Shin Donghyuk and Park Yeonmi. Liberty North Korea (college students in East LA and K-town LA), originally called "Liberation in North Korea". Refugees are subjective. Calling someone a refugee has a lot to do with politics. The US is not so easily convinced that somebody is a refugee. Especially if the US supports the government from which this person comes from.</p>

                       <p>Compare / contrast Gordon's documentary on DPRK and the representations of its people based on prior knowledge / Documentary directorial intent / commentary? Other thoughts?</p>
                       <p>Hatred of the US is ingrained in everyday life for the N Koreans. But they also strongly believe that its' the fault of the US for raiding North Korea and committing atrocities that nobody else knows. So North Koreans believe that they are protecting their culture and their own existenceby hating theUS so much. They're always ready for an attack.</p>
                       <p>Mass Games - April 2002. Awesome show that portrays group mentality and allows the Koreans to develop the idea of true communism. Where nobody is more important than the group. This is done to eliminate any sort of individualism.</p>

                       <p>Three distinct classes that are equal. Peasant, Worker, Intellectual. All classes are equal. Housing in PyongYang is considered</p>
                       <p>Heavy indoctrination - self-reliance ideology / fits perfectly into their version of communism. if they're all together they can achieve their goals. everyone needs to be part of the group mentality. if anyone messes up, the group looks bad. This plus the heavy indoctrination of the Glorious Leader / General on the children forces them to put their self-esteem and full trust in their contribution to the group. The level at which the state comes into your life is interesting. There's radio that you cannot turn off. All interactions are normal. Schoolgirls will be schoolgirls. </p>

They're going on and on about a virus that's probably nonexistent. They're not releasing any information. It's apparently a host of a virus that doesn't exist.

                        <p>This film has many connections to nuclear warfare.a woman How did this creature come to be? They keep talking about the nuclear testing. There is a suggestive theme throughout the movie saying that nuclear warfare is at fault (i.e. the US) for Japan's problems. It has caused much suffering, pain, and loss. The film supports the idea of science but cautions the use of science for destruction. The end of the movie is sad. Today's movies have a "glory" ending. Where the hero fist-bumps his friends and he gets the girl. But this movie ends on a sad note. The movie message is pleading to stop nuclear testing for glory. It only brings pain.</p>
                        <p>There are many scenes in the movie where there is no hero. During Godzilla's attack on Tokyo, a woman says to her children that they will be seeing their father soon.</p>

                        <p>Read excerpt LuXun's Preface</p>
                        <p>How does Lu Xun perceive his country and fellow countrymen? What is his rationale for writing?</p>
                        <p>Lu Xun is very sad and is almost at the point of despair for his fellow countrymen. He is astonished at the lack of empathy for other Chinese people. Other nations have kinda jumped ahead of them and they have to play "catch-up".</p>
                        <p>As LuXun watches this clip of his countrymen, his idea of wanting to better society by healing it shifts from healing the physical to healing the spiritual.</p>
                        <p>How can you change culture? Literature.</p>
                        <p>This is going to be a way to popularize these views. By writing with vernacular Chinese.</p>
                        <p>He's not saying that we're adopting everything that's Western but we're going to create a unique culture that's Chinese.</p>

                    <p>Taoism is all about emptying the mind and ridding oneself of knowledge to achieve happiness. It is the knowledge of the things that you desire and the things that you want that make you unhappy.</p>
                    <p><em>Personally, I disagree with Taoism because I find it self-contradictory. You learn these things so that you can unlearn these things. You find happiness by ridding yourself of knowledge and teachers of this doctrine are hypocrites for teaching this doctrine because they must rid themselves of all knowledge so that they can be happy. I also think that unhappiness can stem from relationships because we may say something hurtful to someone and thereby cause pain to someone. I believe that unhapiness is much more than that. I also believe that hapiness is much more than just ridding yourself of materialism.</em></p>

                        <p>What is the nature of the "white man's burden"?</p>
                        <p>The white man's burden is to educate others, to be a slave to bringing others to your level.</p>
                        <p>Who is the intended audience for this poem?</p>
                        <p>The intended audience is White people. This is around the time of Teddy Roosevelt and Big Stick Diplomacy where people are thinking that they have the right to involve themselves in other peoples' matters.</p>
                        <p>What seems to be the underlying message of this poem?</p>
                        <p>It's an exercise of power. A mission where the white man attempts to civilize "the other". You construct "the other" and you use that to make policy. The white man does all this work for these other peoples and they go and mess it up just like a child. <quote>"Watch sloth and heathen Folly<br>Bring all your hopes to nought."<br>- <em>excerpt</em> from The White Man's Burden</quote> The white man is the one who is going to take these peoples to the promised land but the other doesn't want to go there.</p>
                        <p>People are exploring the world and they're forming their opinions of "the other".</p>

                        <p>This got the US involved directly with the Philippines. Initially, the US is looking out to Cuba. But in the conflict, they also move to the Philippines to provide for Filipino revolutionaries to fight against the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>Spain loses this war and the control of the Philippine Islands is ceded to the US. Pres. McKinley wants to bring these people to view the US as a provider of "benevolent assimilation".</p>
